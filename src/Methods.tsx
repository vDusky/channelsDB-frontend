                        <p style={justify}>
                            Channels (tunnels and pores) are highly important structural pathways within proteins and other biomacromolecules. Tunnels connect internal spaces of 
                            biomacromolecules with exterior enabling, e.g., substrate/product transport towards enzymes’ active sites, nascent synthetized proteins to leave
                             ribosomal proteosynthetic center via ribosomal exit tunnel, etc. Pores are channels passing through the whole biomacromolecular structure, typically
                             facilitating transport of ions or molecules through cellular biomembranes.                    
                        </p>
                        <p style={justify}>
                            Channel walls are made from surrounding amino acids making up for a specific micro-environment (see e.g. <a href='http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12859-014-0379-x' target='_blank' >Pravda and Berka et al.</a>),
                            which influence to a great extent specificity and selectivity of plethora biologically important processes. Their constitution is especially important in channel's
                            constriction sites such as local minima and bottlenecks, which can function as gatekeepers.
                        </p>
                        <p style={justify}>
                            In the database a channel is represented by its centerline (3D natural spline of a given volume), physicochemical properties and lining residues. Channel volume
                            is formed by the distance to the closest protein atom and decomposed into discrete regions called layers. Each layer is defined by the residues lining it.
                            A new layer starts whenever there is a change in residues lining it along its length. Their size and composition is in turn used for estimating channel's 
                            physicochemical properties. These are especially important for local minima and a bottleneck (the narrowest part of the channel).

                        <p style={justify}>MOLE is a software tool used for channel identification throughout the ChannelsDB. First, the algorithm calculates Delaunay triangulation/Voronoi diagram of the atomic centers
                            (see step (1) in the figure). Next, regions suitable for channel identification are calculated using a set of predefined parameters (2,3). Channel starting and end points
                            are identified in these cavity diagrams (4,5) and the most favourable channels are identified among a set of starting points and ending points (6).

                            Once the channels have been identified a unique set of residues surrounding channel volume is retrieved. Given this set of residues, a physicochemical properties such as Hydropathy

                        <p style={justify}>CAVER is a software tool for the detection of tunnels and channels in the protein structures and their ensembles. In the first step, the Voronoi diagram representation
                         of the molecule (A) is constructed and the cost for each Voronoi edge is calculated with respect to its width (B). In the second step, too narrow edges are filtered out and the Djikstra’s 
                         algorithm is used to find all shortest paths to the protein surface (C). In the third step, the tunnels are clustered and too similar tunnels are removed. In the last step, the characteristics 
                         like length and throughput are calculated for all tunnels and their spherical representation is saved (D). CAVER is available as an <a href="https://loschmidt.chemi.muni.cz/caverweb/" target="_blank">online </a>
